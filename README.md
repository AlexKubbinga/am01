## Executive Summary

#### Dataset Limitations:
  Althought the sample size of this data set is	26765, it is important to take into account that it is not a random sample. Since it is sourced from the  website askyourmanager.com, the respondents are already predisposed to fit some sort of group. For example, most respondents have a job already and more than half have recieved a college education or above. That being said, here are the key takeaways of our analysis on the askamanager salary survey.

#### Key Takeaways:
  1. Gender and Salary: Overall there is a statistically significant salary gap between men and woman in the dataset. This is confirmed through multiple methods such as plotting the data, running a T.Test, calculating a confidence interval, and than testing our results through bootstraping. 
  As we looked deeper, however, there are some key differences in the gender salary gap in different industries. To start, the largest gap is seen in the Law industry, which has on avergae a $40,000 difference in salary between men and woman. In comparison, in the Art and Design industry the gender gap switches, as woman have higher average salaries in the field by about $10,000. 
  The industry that had the highest porportion of man were Computing and Tech, while XXXX has the highest porportion of woman. 

  3. Changing Industry and Salary: During our data anlaysis we were curious to see whether changing industries lead to higher annual salaries. We created a graph to depict this and we found that those who didn't switch industry had higher salaries. We then ran a T.test that showed that this difference in average salary between those that remained in the same industry and those that switched was statically significant. 
  In addition, when looking at industry, for both men and women Law is the industry with the highest salary levels. In addition, individuals working in law have the highest education levels. This brings us to our next point of the relationship between education and salary.
  
  3. Education and Salary: Education level was shown to be statistically significant in explaining variation in annual salaries in our linear regression models. Those with professional degrees (MD, JD, etc) on average earned higher salaries. The gender gap is also prevalent within the respondents who have higher education levels. The pay gap between genders is highest at the high school level and gradually lowers until the professional degree level. This shows that as education levels increase, the salary gap gets lower. There is however an exception with the gender pay gap spiking with PhDs.

4. As one would expect, we found that as years of experience in the field increased, average annual salary also increased. This is because as people can more experience they can provide more value and garner a higher salary.  This was shown in the regression models with the different levels in years of experience all being statistically significant.
