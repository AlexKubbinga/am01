## Executive Summary

Dataset Limitations:
  Althought the sample size of this data set is XXX, we had to keep into account that it is not a random sample. Since it is sourced from the blog and website askyourmanager.com, the respondents are already in theory predisposed to fit some sort of group. For example, since they are on this website, most have a job already and are probably educated. 

#Key Takeaways:
  1. Gender and Salary: Overall there is a statistically significant salary gap between men and woman in the dataset. As we looked deeper,however, there are some key differences in the gender salary gap in different industries. To start, the largest gap is seen in the Law industry, which has on avergae a $40,000 difference in salary between men and woman. In comparison, in the Art and Design industry the gender gap switches, as woman have higher average salaries in the field than man of about $10,000. 
  The indutries that had the highest porportion of man were Computing and Tech, 
   
  - Computing & Tech is male intensive

  3. Industry and Salary: During our data anlaysis we were curious to see whether changing industries had a relationship to higher annual salries when looking at the data set. We created a graph to dipict that those who didn't switch had higher salaries and then ran a T.test that showed that this difference was statically significant. 
  
  3. Education and Salary: Education has a impact on salary levels. There is also a gender gap within the respondents who have higher education levels. 
There are different gaps in salary at differnt education levels. Highschool is the highest and then Professional Degree is the lowest. As education levels increase the salary gap gets lower, however there is a spike with PhDs.


Industry Proportions: For both men and women Law is the industry with the highest salary levels. In addition, individuals working in law have the highest education levels.
